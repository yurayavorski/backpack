// HACK:
// This code exists to overcome an issue in react-native@0.55.3 affecting
// iOS 11 whereby font weights for System font (San Francisco) are being
// applied incorrectly e.g. textStyle=xxl renders `.SFUIDisplay-Semibold`
// instead of `.SFUIDisplay-Bold`.
//
// We limit this fix to react-native@0.55.3 specifically because we know
// it is fixed in the upcoming release 0.56.0 release, see the following
// commit:
// https://github.com/facebook/react-native/commit/f50df4f5eca4b4324ff18a49dcf8be3694482b51

import { Platform } from 'react-native';
